The Robot Self-Efficacy Scale 

Scoring: Subscale scores are calculated across subscale items: 
‘Operation subscale - Q1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11. 
‘Application’ subscale – Q4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 

Original scale development (Exploratory Factor Analysis and Confirmatory Factor Analysis) can be found in this publication:
